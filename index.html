    <p> There are few things that compare to the taste of some good thick pancakes with maple sirup straight from the great north, Canada.</p>
    <p> The recipe you're about to read should give you pancakes for about 4 people. Your milage may vary.<br>
         Now to get started cooking these pancakes you're going to need a few things:</p>
         
    <ul>
        <li> 3 cups of flour</li>
        <li> 4.5 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li> 1.5 tsp salt</li>
        <li> 3-4 Eggs, large</li>
        <li> 2.25 cups 2% milk</li>

<article id="process" class="grid-item">
    <p><br> The process is very simple, however if you are <strong>not</strong> using a non stick pan you might want to butter your pan before pouring the batter.<br></p>
    <p > Now let's get started: </p>
    

    <ol>
        <li> Get a large bowl. Now put your dry ingredients in and give them a rough mix.</li>
        <li> While mixing add eggs and milk, then the oil and syrup. Then mix it until its all blended together with no lumps.</li>
        <li> Get a pan heated on medium. Once the pan is hot use a ladle to pour in the batter.</li>
        <li> Flip once the bubbles start comming through to the top and the bottom is golden brown.</li>
        <li> Serve with maple sirup and a bit of butter.</li>
    </ol>
